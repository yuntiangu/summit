## Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

### Project Description: 

Summit is a productivity app. It is a Tasker that helps us manage our tasks. Specifically, the purpose of Summit is to have a seamless integration between the application and LumiNUS platform. This is accomplished through having our application be built on the Flutter framework, which will conveniently cater to both Android and iOS users.



Our current phase (Phase 1), is to familiarise ourselves with the Flutter framework, setting up Firebase as our cloud database and online authentication for our users, and finalising our mockups while creating the skeletons for the application (To-Do List and Calendar Page).



Our next phase (Phase 2), would be focused on improving the back-end of our application. Firstly, we would ensure that each user’s tasks and events are stored within firebase. Thereafter, we would implement a notifications system to remind users of their upcoming events and tasks due dates. We would then integrate our application with each student’s LumiNUS data. This would include our app sending notifications in-sync with LumiNUS’ announcements and Task Due Countdown Timer.  Phase 2 will also entail the app having capabilities to track a user’s progress in task completion.



The final phase (Phase 3) outline would be working on the gamification side of our app, whereby the users would receive new app icons on each milestone of task completed as rewards for their consistency and hard work. Thereafter, we would improve the entire UI of our app, including the addition of animations for a smoother app experience. 



For our Source Code Control System, we would be using Git.

Aim: To create an application to improve the productivity levels of NUS students.

Target audience: NUS Students

Problem Statement: 
>As students, we participate in many different activities, be it handling our modules, joining CCAs or committees. This causes us to often lose track of our tasks at hand, causing us to miss deadlines or be late for meetings. 

>While there are many planner apps in the market, we identified a few key problems with them:

>Having to manually key in all of our tasks and lessons is extremely troublesome
Most planner apps do not include features to encourage us to remain productive


## Our Solution: 

We created a planner app which includes a calendar and to-do list. Our app would be integrated with LumiNUS, allowing for lectures and tutorial timeslots to be displayed on the calendar. The quizzes and homework would be displayed in our to-do list. 
We would be including a simple gamification feature into our app. There will be a page which tracks the user’s progress for each module, showing the percentage of tasks they have completed for that module. This serves to be a reality check for the user, ensuring that they do not lag behind in any modules. 
Additionally, we have a rewards system, whereby as the user completes tasks, he would be able to win new app icons.
